# Notes

## `bash/.bash_profile`
When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option,
it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.
After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order,
and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable

## `bash/.bashrc`
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc

## Go & private Git servers
To get `go get` to work with private Git servers, like BitBucket server, `ssh-add` the SSH key and then
`git config --global.url url."ssh://git@server:port/".insteadOf "https://server/scm"`
